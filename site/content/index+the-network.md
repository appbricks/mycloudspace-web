## The Network

Hotspots allow us to connect our devices to the internet via wi-fi. The simplicity of the setup has given us a false sense of security without any awareness of the dangers that we are exposed to, even when we use secure mechanisms to access online content and services. These days phishing, malaware and man-in-the middle attacks have become a few of the most common ways hackers gain access to personal devices and data. We need tools that allow us to observe, detect and prevent such attacks and isolate our devices before the damage is done. To do this we need to secure and monitor the medium over which data is transmitted; the network that connects us to the internet and the world-wide-web.
