## Our Story

Our story began in 2015 when we helped a startup build their cloud infrastructure in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Being a Fintech startup it was necessary to think of security right at the inception of the project. Hence, using our experience building software-based infrastructure at previous employers, we built a completely sandboxed Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS secured via VPN. Only required resources were exposed to the public via a DMZ layer in the VPC. This entire solution was automated enabling us to stand up sandboxed environments in any one of the AWS regions. Sadly the Fintech never took off and we moved on with our careers with different employers.

Over the years the remnants of this project have been used to setup sandboxed cloud environments for friends and family to be able to access internet resources anonymously. These tools, namely the VPN service have become a regular fixture in our daily activities professionally and personally. For example, in some of the countries we have lived and worked in, the VPN service has become a necessity when making Voice-Over-IP or Video Conference calls in order to bypass restrictions enforced by local Telcos,. Fast forward a few years and an idea formed and AppBricks was formed and we worked on productizing the automation that was created for the first project in 2015.

At the end of 2019 we released the first iteration of our efforts, which was the ability for consumers to build, manage and run a cloud space secured by a VPN with minimal effort using a CLI on you workstation. In its basic form, this VPN service can be used to anonymize your internet activity like most VPNs do. However, this is not where the product capability ends. Stay tuned and visit our products page to see new products that will be released as we bring more features to market.
