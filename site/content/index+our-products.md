## Bringing The Cloud Closer To Home

As the lines between our physical and digital lives begin to blur, it is important that we protect our activity and data from bad actors. But how do we do that as our lives become increasingly dependent on digital devices that are always on and conneccted to the internet. The goal of Appbricks is to bring to market a suite of products that will help you secure your digital presence allowing you to place all you digital devices and data into a walled sandbox, but at the same allow you to interact with the larger internet safely and anonymously. Within this sandbox you will be able to launch peer-to-peer applications and services that only trusted friends and family you invite can interact with.
