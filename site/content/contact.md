## Contact

Please direct all product inquiries to our marketing email. To get support on a product issue send an email to support with a detailed description of your issue and you will be invited to a slack channel, where our support engineers will help you resolve the issue.

Please note we are a startup and the product is under heavy development. So although the product will deliver its core functionality, problems and issues are not unexpected in the short term. However, we depend on you as the user to identify any issues that slip through our quality assurance processes, so we can build a better product.
