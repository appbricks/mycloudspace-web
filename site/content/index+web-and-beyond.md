## The Web and Beyond

Once you have secured the foundation on which your devices connect, you can then install apps within the sandbox that enrich your digital engagement. Within this walled environment friends and family can interact from across the world without the digital footprint of their activity ever leaving the sandbox. The decentralized and peer-to-peer capabilities of the platform makes it possible for applications that do not depend on centralized cloud services to function within the sandbox, paving the way to securely adopt new standards and technology that is shaping the Web3 capabilities of the internet. With this technology decentralized social networks can evolve and grow as we connect sandboxes in a global decentralized social platform.
