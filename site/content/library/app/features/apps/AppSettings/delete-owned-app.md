As you own this app it is recommended that you delete it using the MyCS admin client you use to deploy and configure spaces and apps. This dialog will only delete the app metadata and user associations and will not delete any cloud resources created for the app. If you delete an app that is still deployed you will have to manually delete the app's cloud resources. If you still want to delete the app reference from the MyCS database please enter the name of the app you wish to delete and click the delete button.
