As you own this space it is recommended that you delete it using the MyCS admin client you use to deploy and configure spaces. This dialog will only delete the space metadata and user space associations and will not delete any cloud resources created for the space. If you delete a space that is still deployed you will have to manually delete the space's cloud resources. If you still want to delete the space reference from the MyCS database please enter the name of the space you wish to delete and click the delete button.
