## Launch Your Cloud Space Environment

Your cloud space is a virtual private network in the cloud that is secured by a VPN. All ingress into that network is required to pass through this VPN ensuring any activity originating from your access point is secured and anonymized from snooping by intermediaries. Once your space has been configured you can install additional applications and services developed by AppBricks or third-party developers which are distributed through our marketplace.
