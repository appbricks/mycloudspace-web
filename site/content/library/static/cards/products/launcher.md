## Your Cloud Space Environment

Your cloud space is a virtual private network in the cloud that is secured by peer-to-peer VPN clients. You use the client to deploy a Cloud Space control node to the cloud and invite users to the space via the **[MyCloudSpace](/mycs)** control center. Once your space has been configured you can use the client to install additional applications and services developed by AppBricks or third-party developers which are distributed through our marketplace.
