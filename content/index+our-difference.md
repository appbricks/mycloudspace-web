# Our Difference

At AppBricks we make your privacy and security the number one priority when creating our products. We would like our customers to have the same class of security and privacy that enterprises put in place to secure their data and activity from external threats. This means providing enterprise grade automation, encryption and protection without compromising your freedom to conduct your business on the internet. 

Our products will give you this as well as the observality required to manage the activity of your household on the internet. We are not a service provider, but will instead give you the tools necessary to build, run and manage your own cloud space and services in any one of the public cloud providers. Managing cost and migrating data across clouds will be a few of the core capabilities of these tools.
