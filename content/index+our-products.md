# Bringing The Cloud Closer To Home

We are living in an increasingly connected world consuming cloud services at an ever increasing space. Where once our personal data lived within our own sandbox at home, it is now spread across these cloud services. Although these internet companies presume to protect our data they are ever vulnerable, as the attack surface spreads with their growth. Moreover, the pressure to become profitable drive them to take increasing amounts of risk and resort to questionable business practices with our data. The goal of Appbricks is to bring to market a suite of products that will help you extend your home sandbox to the cloud and at the same time interact with the larger internet safely and anonymously. Within this sandbox you will be able to launch a set of peer-to-peer services that will include only friends and family you invite. Only you will have access to the data and activity within this sandbox giving back to you control of your data.
